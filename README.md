# 🧠 Intelligent Code Analysis & Optimization System

An intelligent, rule-based system that analyzes Python source code, detects control-flow complexity, and generates **explainable optimization variants** focused on readability, performance, and maintainability.

This project demonstrates how static analysis and structured refactoring rules can provide meaningful insights into code quality without relying on large language models.
